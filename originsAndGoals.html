<h2>origins and goals</h2>

<p>The project started in 2001. It came from several observations that can be done on a global scale: degradation of environment and increase of injustice between humans. Events since this time did not deny these statements.<p>
<p>If finance allows investment that gives the power required by any project of significant scale, acceleration of transactions allowed by the use of software and networks fed a speculation in such a way that finance looks like a casino at a planetary scale. However, finance is the mean necessary to the economy.<p>
<p>The alternative not celebrated is barter. It comes with dramatic suffering such as events following 1929 that remain in all memories. Even if barter plays the same role than money with regard to the market economy, transactions are so complex to settle that economy is nearly paralyzed. It is this low liquidity that gives the preference to the money at the beginning of the historic period.<p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no other alternative than finance or barter to regulate the market economy. Then we can wonder if it would be possible to use the means that allowed the expension of finance to modernize barter and increase it's liquidity.<p>
<p>The results of this project responds positively to the question. They make possible the creation of market places that do not require a unique monetary standard to express prices. They allow settlement of exchange cycles with more than two partners that increase drastically possible combinations and consequently liquidity of barter.<p>
<p>By considering money as a value among others monetary frontiers desappear, and finance recovers its role by serving human economy. These market places would constitue means to allocate ecological resources on an empoisoned planet whose increasing polulation clain everyday louder a fair sharing of ecological resources. This sharing is the unique alternative to a slow and ineluctable increase of inconceivable humain sufferings.<p>
