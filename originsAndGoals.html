<h2>origins</h2>

<p>The project was started in 2001 by Olivier Chaussavoine. It came from several observations that can be done on a global scale: degradation of environment and increase of injustice between humans. Events since this time did not deny these statements.</p>
<p>If money allows investment that gives the power required by any project of significant scale, acceleration of transactions allowed by the use of software and networks fed a speculation in such a way that finance looks like a casino at a planetary scale. However, money remains the mean necessary to the economy.</p>
<p>The alternative not celebrated is barter. It comes with dramatic sufferings such as events following 1929 that remain in all memories. Even if barter plays the same role than money with regard to the market economy, transactions are so complex to settle that economy is nearly paralyzed. It is this low liquidity that gave the preference to the money at the beginning of the historic period.</p>
<p>There is no other alternative than money and barter to regulate the market economy. The question at the beginning of the project was if it would be possible to use the means that allowed the expension of finance to modernize barter and increase it's liquidity.</p>

<p>The first results of this project gave a positive answer to this question. They made possible the creation of market places that do not require any monetary reference. By allowing exchange cycles with more than two partners possible exchange combinations are drastically increased, increasing liquidity of barter in the same proportion.<p>

<h2>Barter economy</h2>
<p>Let's imagine a world where scarcity is not the privilege of money, where each scarce ecological resource is counted like money and where values are exchanged using these kind of markets.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Sustainability could be acheived simply: identify scarce resources and manage them like others.</li>
<li>Economy metrics would directly provide necessary scoreboard of stocks and variations.</li>
<li>It would not be necessary to beleive rating agencies to know how true a value is.</li>
<li>By considering money as a value among others, monetary frontiers desappear, and market becomes really free.</li>
<li>Financial mechanisms can be applied to any fungible recovering their role by serving human economy.</li>
</ul>
<p>These market places provide means to allocate ecological resources on an empoisoned planet whose increasing population clains everyday louder a fair sharing of resources. This sharing is the unique alternative to a slow and ineluctable increase of inconceivable humain sufferings.</p>
