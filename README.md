openbarter
==========

openBarter is a database defining a barter market. It implements the economic mechanisms of a regular market and allows exchange between more than two partners (the buyer and the seller) in a single transaction. It does not require any central monetary standard to quantify the value exchanged and to express prices to be compared. It provides a liquidity equivalent to that of a regular market place.
