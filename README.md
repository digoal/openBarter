openBarter
==========

openBarter is a barter market of fungible values defined by a quality and a quantity. It implements the economic mechanisms of a regular market ( central limit order book). Exchanges can be bilateral (between buyer and seller) or non-bilateral. Owners put barter orders on the stack offering a value in exchange of an other. The ratio beween the quatity provided and the quantity required measures the will to exchange of the owner. This ratio is used to implement a competition between possible exchange cycles. It does not any central monetary standard to do it. The low liquidity of barter is only true for bilateral exchange but not openBarter.
