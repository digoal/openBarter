openBarter
==========

openBarter is the central part of a barter market extending mechanisms of a regular market ( central limit order book - CLOB). From quantities offered and required by barter orders, it performs competition without the requirement of a currency to express prices between possible cycles. Fluidity and profit is higher than what would be obtained with a regular CLOB.
