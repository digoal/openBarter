<h1>openBarter</h1>

<p>openBarter is a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">postgreSQL</a> database extension defining a barter market. It implements the economic mechanisms of a regular market and allows cyclic exchange between more than two partners (buyer and seller) in a single transaction. Even if competition is performed between offers, it does not require any central monetary standard to quantify the value exchanged and express prices to be compared. It provides a liquidity equivalent to that of a regular market place.</p>
<p>Low liquidity of barter explains why money is prefered to barter. Mainstream economists present barter as the archaic ancestor of money. However it has always been the result of a disfonctionning financial system. By allowing exchanges with more than two partners the barter market becomes nearly as liquid as a regular market using money. The competition between groups of more than two partners fosters cooperation inside groups, as well as economic performance.</p>
<p> The database finds possible relations between bids (exchange proposals) and creates draft agreements for approval by owners. When agreements are accepted by partners, the property of related values is exchanged between partners.</p>
