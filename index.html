<h1>openBarter</h1>

<p>openBarter is a postgres database extension defining a barter market. It implements the economic mechanisms of a regular market and allows cyclic exchange between more than two partners (buyer and seller) in a single transaction. Even if competition is performed between offers, it does not require any central monetary standard to quantify the value exchanged and express prices to be compared. It provides a liquidity equivalent to that of a regular market place.</p>
