<h1>openBarter</h1>
<p>The goal of economy is to make the best use of scarce resources available. World wide resources are decreasing while it's population grows.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_order_book">central limit order book</a> (CLOB) is the key component of a market, and markets organize economy. openBarter is a CLOB performing competition without the requirement of a central currency to express prices. It can be used to exchange property of any value that can be measured with a standard including natural resources, ecological quota, energy and even currencies.</p>

<h2>Potential applications</h2>

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt>Scarcity of resources</dt>
<dd>Management of scarcity of money performed by markets can be applied to any resource and market economy remains efficient even with drastic rationing.</dd>
<dt>Ecological governor</dt>
<dd>Use of each resource can be limited independently of others while maintaining the efficiency of the ecological governor performed by markets. No need of global aggregates such as CO2 quota and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global-warming_potential">GWP</a>. Ecological governor remains efficient even with a deep economic crisis.</dd>
<dt>For countries with rich underground</dt>
<dd>Most are also poor with a weak currency. Save underground resources while decrease economic unbalance.</dd>
<dt>Smart grid</dt>
<dd>Allow energy, water or waste quota exchange for each level of the smart grib independently of others.</dd>
<dt>Community currencies(CC)</dt>
<dd>Allow economic exchange between CCs or between CC and fiat money without compromizing the CC sovereignty.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
 
<h2>Overview</h2>

<object data="static/images/logo.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object>
<p>openBarter accepts barter orders from owners and produces movements exchanging ownership between them. It allows cyclic exchange between more than two partners. Each value has a pecular <em>quality</em> and is measured by a <em>quantity</em> using the standard related to this quality. openBarter accepts barter orders of the form:</p>
<div class="verseblock">
<div class="verseblock-content">I propose a value in exchange of an other for a ratio ω.
</div>
</div>
<p>A price measures the <em>will to exchange</em>. The ratio <em>ω = (quantity offered)/(quantity required)</em>  measures the same <em>will</em> with different units: It grows as the <em>quantity offered</em> and decreases as the <em>quantity required</em> grows. The market finds potential exchange cycles with two partners or more and performs a competition between them. This competition between potential cycles is based on the product of their ω.</p>

<h2>Orders</h2>
<p>Can be:</p>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt>barter submission</dt>
<dd>Unilateral commitment to exchange a value owned by the author of the order. Several requirements can be expressed for a single value offered.</dd>
<dt>quote submission</dt>
<dd>Provides the result of a barter order without committment. Equivalent of a price discovery but applied to ω. The order book remains unchanged by this order.</dd>
<dt>barter removal</dt>
<dd>Removes barter orders related to a single value provided.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>A movement provides a quantity and recieves an other. It is related to barter order. The ratio <em>ω' = (quantity provided)/(quantity received)</em> is the result of a compromize between barter orders of the exchange cycle where the economic product of the exchange is fairly distributed between partners of the cycle. A barter LIMIT order is used when the author of the barter order requires that <em>ω'>=ω</em>, otherwise a barter BEST order is used. Quote can also be BEST or LIMIT.</p>

<h2>Differences with a regular market</h2>
<p>The competition between potential cycles maximizes a non-dimensional quantity Ω that is the mathematical product of ω of orders of a cycle. When applied to bilateral exchange cycles, the choice made by this competition on Ω is the same as what would be obtained using the best price rule. But the difference between Ω maximization and individual profit maximization of the best price rule appears when cycles have more than two partners. As ω measures the individal exchange will, their product Ω on a cycle can be seen as measuring the collective exchange will. In this sense, maximizing  Ω or the collective exchange will is compliant with a fundamental democratic principles.</p>

<h2>Performances</h2>
<p>Openbarter is an extension of <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">postgreSQL</a>, the linux of databases.</p> 
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt>maximum number of cycles partners</dt>
<dd>64</dd>
<dt>atomic transactions</dt>
<dd>Exchange cycles are wrapped in atomic transactions with full <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">ACID</a> property.</dd>
<dt>fluidity</dt>
<dd>Simulations show that the fluidity and opportunities of both cooperation and profit are better than with a regular CLOB. Non-bilateral cycles increase cooperation for low order book volumes while increasing competition for higher volumes.</dd>
<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_threshold">percolation threasold</a></dt>
<dd>An emty order book does not provide any movement, but the flow of values grows as the volume of the order book. A threasold of fluidity is observed when the volume of the book increases depending on the diversity of qualities of the market. This treasold appears earlier for openBarter than for a regular CLOB.</dd>
<dt>Speed</dt>
<dd>The exploration of potential cycles is limited in width and depth providing high speed even with a large order book and despite of the complexity of combinatorics. Simulation provided a mean time of 150 milliseconds for the execution of a single barter order with 100 000 orders on a small laptop.</dd>
<dt>Security</dt>
<dd>Security mechanisms offered by postgreSql are not restricted by openBarter implementation.</dd>
